# üõ°Ô∏è PhishSOC-Lab ‚Äì SOC Phishing Detection & Analysis Sandbox

**PhishSOC-Lab** is a hands-on cybersecurity project designed to help analysts and engineers **detect, analyze, and respond to phishing threats** in a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

This lab demonstrates how to:

- Deploy a Wazuh SIEM (single-node) using Docker.

- Simulate a mail server (Postfix/Dovecot) to generate phishing emails.

- Collect and forward mail server logs using Wazuh Agent.

- Write and test custom Wazuh rules to detect phishing patterns (subjects, domains, attachments).
 
- Visualize and monitor alerts in SOC dashboards.

- Practice IOC extraction and enrichment (domains, hashes, URLs).

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Provide a **sandbox environment** for phishing analysis.

- Teach analysts how to **configure and extend SIEM rules**.

- Show how phishing activity can be detected using **real log sources**.

- Enable SOC teams to practice **threat hunting and incident response** in a controlled setup.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
**üîÑ Flow Explanation**
1. **Phishing Email Simulation**
   - A **Postfix/Dovecot mail server** generates and receives simulated phishing emails.
   - These emails may contain suspicious subjects, domains, or attachments.
2. **Log Collection**
   - The **Wazuh Agent** installed on the mail server forwards log files (Postfix, Dovecot, syslog) to the **Wazuh Manager**.
3. **Detection & Rules**
   - The **Wazuh Manager** applies **custom phishing detection rules**.
   - Suspicious emails are flagged based on IOC matches (domains, hashes, URLs, attachment names).
4. **Indexing & Storage**
   - Alerts and logs are processed and stored by the **Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch)**.
5. **Visualization**
   - The **Wazuh Dashboard** provides SOC analysts with real-time visualization of phishing attempts, alerts, and threat hunting dashboards.

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### 1. Wazuh Deployment & Configuration

**1.1 Clone the official Wazuh Docker repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git
cd wazuh-docker/single-node
```

**1.2 Run the following command to generate the desired certificates:**

```bash
docker-compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator
```

**1.3 Start Wazuh single-node containers:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- This deploys Wazuh Manager, Indexer, and Dashboard containers.
- Wait for all containers to be fully up (docker ps to verify).

**1.4 Verify the deployment:**

```bash
docker logs wazuh.manager
```

- Ensure no errors and that Wazuh Manager started successfully.

**1.5 Open Wazuh Dashboard:**

- Go to `https://localhost` in your browser.

- Log in with the default credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `SecretPassword`

### 2. Mail Server Deployment & Testing

**2.1 Clone PhishSOC-Lab Project**

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/ilyess-sellami/PhishSOC-Lab.git
cd PhishSOC-Lab/mailserver
```

**2.2 Run Mail Server**

The project already contains a minimal `docker-compose.yml` for a test mail server.

Start it with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will run a simple Postfix + Dovecot mail server exposing:

- SMTP: localhost:25

- IMAP: localhost:143

**2.3 Add a Mailbox**

Create a test mailbox inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it mailserver setup email add test@phishsoc.lab 'Test1234'
```

**2.4 Verify mailbox creation**

```bash
docker exec -it mailserver setup email list
```

You should see your new mailbox.

**2.5 Send a Test Phishing Email**

Use `swaks` to simulate a phishing message

Install swaks (on Ubuntu/Mac):

```bash
sudo apt-get install swaks   # Linux
brew install swaks           # Mac
```

Send a fake phishing email:

```bash
swaks --server localhost --from attacker@evil.com --to test@phishsoc.lab \
  --header "Subject: URGENT: Verify Your Bank Account Now" \
  --body "Dear user, please click this link to verify your bank account: http://malicious-site.com/login"
```

### 3. Wazuh Rules Configuration

**3.1 Copy your phishing rules into the running Wazuh Manager container**

```bash
docker cp local_rules.xml single-node-wazuh.manager-1:/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml
```

- Replace single-node-wazuh.manager-1 with the actual container name from docker ps.

- You can use your example file from /config/local_rules.xml on your GitHub project.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The local_rules.xml provided are just for testing. You can create your own rules and test them following the steps below.

**3.2 Restart the Wazuh Manager container**

```bash
docker restart single-node-wazuh.manager-1
```

**3.3 Verify Wazuh Manager logs**

```bash
docker logs -f single-node-wazuh.manager-1
```

- Check that there are no XML errors and that your phishing rules are loaded successfully.


### 4. Install Wazuh Agent on the Mail Server (Docker)

**4.1 Open Wazuh Dashboard**

- Go to Wazuh dashboard
- Navigate to **Agents ‚Üí Add agent**

**4.2 Select the Agent**

- Choose **Linux DEB amd64**
- Server address: `<your-wazuh-ip-address>`
- Agent name: `mail-server-agent`
- Group: `default`

![Wazuh Add Agent](screenshots/wazuh_add_agent.png)

**4.3 Run the installation commands inside the mail server container**

Enter the container:

```bash
docker exec -it mailserver bash
```

(where `mailserver` is your container name).

Update packages inside the container:

```bash
apt-get update
```

Then run:

```bash
wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/pool/main/w/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent_4.12.0-1_amd64.deb && \
WAZUH_MANAGER='<your-wazuh-ip-address>' WAZUH_AGENT_NAME='mail-server-agent' dpkg -i ./wazuh-agent_4.12.0-1_amd64.deb
```

**4.4 Start the agent**

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wazuh-agent
systemctl start wazuh-agent
```

**4.5 Verify agent is running**

```bash
systemctl status wazuh-agent
tail -f /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
```

**4.6 Check Dashboard**

- Go back to **Wazuh Dashboard ‚Üí Agents list**.
- You should see `mail-server-agent` with status **Active ‚úÖ**.

## 5. simulate phishing attaque

**5.1 Send a test phishing email using `swaks`**

```bash
swaks --server localhost --from attacker@evil.com --to test@phishsoc.lab \
--header "Subject: URGENT: Verify Your Bank Account Now" \
--body "Click this malicious link: http://maliciousdomain.com"
```

- `--server localhost` ‚Üí connect to the local mail server
- `--from` ‚Üí sender email
- `--to` ‚Üí recipient email
- `--header` ‚Üí subject line
- `--body` ‚Üí email body, containing a test malicious URL

**5.2 Verify that the email reached the mailbox**

Check your mail server logs (inside the mail container):

```bash
tail -f /var/log/mail/mail.log
```

You should see the email being delivered to `test@phishsoc.lab`.

**5.3 Filter alerts in Wazuh Discover**

1. Open Wazuh **Dashboard ‚Üí Discover**.

2. Select the index: `wazuh-alerts-*`.

3. Add a filter: `agent.name: "mail-server-agent"`

You should now see alerts triggered by your test phishing email based on the rules in `local_rules.xml`.
